### Nostalgic Note Taking: re-imagining old school paper texts and sticky notes‚Äù

### Inspiration

As students who lived through the transformation of main-stream note-taking from paper to digital, we have many childhood note-taking memories 
we miss out with the new generation software. To relive those nostalgic experiences, we created a note-taking web application that reenacts the 
efficiency and simplicity of note-taking with paper book and sticky notes. Furthermore, we brought a modern twist to this studying process by involving 
assistance from AI to consicely, quickly, and accurately summarize highhlighted knowledge.

This project was made by (us) four University of Toronto students, who are also beginner-hackers, during the 2024 UofTHacks 11.
The theme of this hackathon was: Nostalgia!

### How it Works & What its Built with

Sticky allows users to upload pdf files of their study material and make highlighted annotations alongside sticky notes summaries 
that can be both self-written and AI-generated. This program is realized mainly through the use of HTML front-end, CSS styling, and 
JavaScript back-end. 

### Challenges

Some of the challenges we ran into includes choosing a suitable framwork. We explored many frameworks and found each with their own
benefits, but ultimately, due to time pressure we landed on creating an HTML web-app using JS and CSS for front and 
back-end interactions. In addition, this was our first hackathon project for which we had implemented an API usage, there much of our 
work period were spend on debugging for the linkage and application. FInally, the biggest challenge we faced was researching the possibility 
of annotating a PDF on web. Or at least, we wished to let our user experience the process of anotation with sticky notes. :)

### Accomplishments & Learning Outcomes
We are most proud of the massive amount of new inforamtion we acquired during this hackathon. We saw endless potentials in our idea and continuously 
worked to solve any problems that occurred during its realization. (NEVER GIVE UP !!!) Our learning focused on front-end programming and additional 
decision-making that comes with idea designs. Intitially, we had many ideas for our project and wanted to explore as many libraries and APIs as possible. 
However, throughout the implementation, we recognized that capatibility plays a big role in software and that we had to develop better prioritizations
for the choices we make.

### What's Next for Sticky?
We still have many exciting and lingering features we wish to add onto the current Sticky! This includes export options for downloading the annotated notes
for portable learning, and adding option for uploading self-written notes and compare it with lecture slides or textbooks to further improve their 
note-taking skills. :D
